                    NUSHDev is a community of coding enthusiasts in NUS High School, or NUSHS. We aim to positively impact students in NUSHS through our projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are an unofficial group - that is, the school does not endorse or support us, neither do we seek the school's validation.

                    We work on a wide range of projects as a team, aiming to benefit the student community. Beyond that, some of us also undertake personal projects that we think will help make students' lives just that little bit better.
